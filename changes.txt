Some important file locations:

1) rogue.c

	To force everyone to play the game using the "default" character
	attributes, set "def_attr=TRUE" here (line 117).  It is currently
	set to FALSE.

	Otherwise, if people want to play a character with its default
	attributes, they have to set the ROGUEOPTS environment variable
	to default before starting the game.  Example ROGUEOPT variables:

	setenv ROGUEOPTS="default"
	setenv ROGUEOPTS="default, nopickup name=Corwin, class=fighter"
	setenv ROGUEOPTS="nopickup, name=Merlin, class=magician"

2) save.c 

        Code is set to allow multiple saved game restarts. (lines 253 & 274).
	Code is currently set to allow this.

3) init.c

        Beginning game "help" message is defined here (line 16).

4) mach_dep.h

	The default location of the scorefile is set here (line 14).
        Re-define (#define PLAYTIME 1) to allow only prime-shift playing
        times (line 105).  Currently turned off, you can play anytime.

5) command.c

        When the character and game descriptions are finished (see help.c)
        give access to them via the '\' command in command.c (line 337).
	Until then, the '\' command does nothing.

6) rogue.h

        Line 58 determines how many players can be listed in the scorefile.
        Currently set to 20.

7) wizard.c

        The wizard password ought not be messed with.  (see line 558).

The file clrln.c and clrln.h were an attempt to kludge "curses" and
are expendable (if possible).

Additionally, the scorefile needs to be created with the proper file
permissions if multiple players are to use the scorefile.  The game
itself should have file permissions of 2555 (set-GID) and the scorefile
permissions should be 660.  Scorefile name: /usr/games/lib/xrogue_roll.
Game is set-GID, so the scorefile needs to be grouped to the same id.
